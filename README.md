# w241_socialnorms

This is where Swetha, Shalini, and Anusha do their work for w241 final project on Assessing the Effectiveness of a Social Norms-Based Sexual Violence 
Prevention Digital Campaign on the UC Berkeley Campus.

You'll find our data in the data folder & code is in the notebooks folder. All hyperlinks in the final report pdf become accessible if you download the pdf!

Finally, here's a link to the deck: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTbC4Gj_YMPwObqEBJXwTqyE0LLCoBZT4STStxcu7srqGUtRyX1PDmfxGIzudeYBJvI87HWIm7ij1jq/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000

We are humbled to have worked with the PATH To Care Center on campus, without whose domain expertise and mentorship, we would not have produced this work.
