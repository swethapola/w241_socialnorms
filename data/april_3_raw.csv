My girlfriend introduced me to this place over a year ago and I've been hooked ever since!! To a point where they know my order and begin preparing it for me the minute I walk in (even though they don't need to but it always charms me). Sometimes I like to switch it up but the Caramelo Mio is just so damn good. I've brought all my friends here and they never let us down. I recommend the food also. It never ceases to amaze me everything this establishment can take on, like the local art and vendor fairs they have. They definitely bring the community together and make this a great place that I'm happy to call home. - Was this review helpful?","Q17.2_1 - 62 Service Review (coffee shop)

This is a great place to stay for the price. It is very clean and very close to train stations and underground lines. I stayed for 3 nights. When I looked at hotels, they were all very expensive. So, I ended up booking here. The room wasn’t quite what I was expecting after looking at the photos but, again, for the price it was fine. The only thing that worried me a little was that the apartment building was a little off the Main Street and I felt a little vulnerable walking back on my own at night.

This is not my first yoga mat I've bought and I love Gaiam mats, so when I found this online at a cheaper price I was happy. What I was not counting on was the SMELL. It has such a strong chemical smell it literally turns my stomach! I even tried washing it, but with yoga mats you have to use an extremely mild detergent on it, and a mild detergent did not touch the odor. This is not exactly an item you can febreeze either. Needless to say, I am not a happy customer. I should have paid the 7-10 dollars more and bought it from a brick and mortar retailer. - Was this review helpful?","Q19.2_1 - 82 Product Review (yoga mat)

My transaction itself was great; item was shipped on time and I'm very happy with that part. As for the product itself, I've used it a few times and it is definitely not ""instant""! When using the pressure cook feature it takes almost 20 minutes JUST to build up pressure, and then another 15-30 minutes to let pressure out naturally (which some recipes call for). I made a pot roast and veggies, which is not complicated, and from start to finish it took me almost two hours to cook the meal - which was a ton of waiting!! It makes good food, but I'm not sure I'll use it in the future considering how disappointed I was with how long it actually takes. - Was this review helpful?","Q21.2_1 - 102 Product Review (Hot Pot)

Tsui was transferring trains on his way home after picking up N95 masks when he was approached by a man on the platform.

 

The man asked, “You’re Chinese, right?” Tsui responded that he was Chinese American, and the man told Tsui he should go back to his country, citing the 2003 SARS outbreak as another example of “all these sicknesses” spread by “chinks.” The man kept coming closer and closer to Tsui, who was forced to step toward the edge of the platform.

 

“Leave him alone. Can’t you see he’s a nurse? That he’s wearing scrubs?” said a bystander, who Tsui says appeared to be Latino. After the bystander threatened to re­cord the incident and call the police, the aggressor said that he should “go back to [his] country too.”

 

When the train finally arrived, the aggressor sat right across from Tsui and glared at him the entire ride, mouthing, “I’m watching you.” Throughout the ride, Tsui debated whether he should get off the train to escape but feared the man would follow him without anyone else to bear witness to what might happen.



Tsui says the current anti­racism movements are important, but the U.S. has a long way to go to achieve true equality. “One thing’s for sure, it’s definitely not an overnight thing—I am skeptical that people can be suddenly woke after reading a few books off the recommended book lists,” he says.“Let’s be honest, before George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, there were many more. Black people have been calling out in pain and calling for help for a very long time.”

 
What was Justin Tsui's profession?","Q37.4 - ""Grey was out walking her dog on March 17 when she was body-slammed by a stranger. The aggressor also kicked Grey’s dog, which howled in pain. In the moments before the attack, Grey was bent over, picking up her dog’s waste, and her hood fell over her head. She couldn’t see the stranger approaching and was already in a vulnerable position.

 

Grey was the only one on the block wearing a mask at the time, and her eyes were visible above it—“That’s probably what immediately identified me as Asian to them,” she says. Later, she shared the incident on Instagram, using her platform to spark conversation and bring awareness to the issue. “In my last post about the racism I’ve experienced during this virus hysteria, I expressed gratitude that at least I wasn’t assaulted. I guess I can’t claim that anymore,” wrote Grey, who urged her nearly 400,000 followers to “take the time to be extra empathetic and kind to strangers to hopefully make up for their treatment from the rest of the world.”

 

“As horrifying, triggering and deplorable as what happened to me was, it was the one and only time I actually felt like there could be bodily harm inflicted on me,” she says. “Some people live in fear of that all the time.”
